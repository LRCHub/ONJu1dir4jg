Contamination breach
In sector seven G
Evacuation protocols
For Project Legion in effect
Beginning emergency
Shutdown in 5 seconds
Four, three, two, one
Zero

I breathe alone
My skin begins to peel
Forsaken in my misery
To battle this ordeal
I can't resist the cravings
No, I have to ease the pain
My screaming brain
Is melting slowly
Turning me insane

Devastation
All across the nation
Infected, but I am not alone
My days are numbered
But I am patient
From zero the counting has begun

I resist resistance
I survive the hangman's noose
Future looks sinister
I'm a zombie on the loose
'Cause I feed in darkness
I feast in broad daylight
Whatever you do
Better hold on tight
And stay out of my sight

Evacuation
All across the nation
Infected, but I am not alone
Our days are numbered
And we are patient
To zero the countdown has begun

We exist
But our hearts don't beat
The streets, our sacred haven
Fight or flee
Don't waste another round

We exist
But our eyes run red
The dead will feast upon you
Aiming high, don't choke
Or you'll be downed

Retribution
A suicide solution
Infected, but you are not alone
All lives are numbered
And we are patient
To zero the counting has begun
